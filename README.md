Link Shortener Project:


This project is a simple link shortener web application built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.



Overview:


The link shortener allows users to convert long URLs into shorter, more manageable links. It provides a convenient way to share links while conserving character space, especially in contexts like social media posts or text messages.



Features:


Shorten Links: Users can input long URLs and generate short, unique links for sharing.

Custom URLs: Optionally, users can customize the shortened URL slug for easier recall.

Redirects: Shortened links redirect users seamlessly to the original long URL.

Analytics: Basic analytics are provided, tracking the number of times a shortened link has been accessed.


Technologies Used:
Node.js: JavaScript runtime used for server-side development.
Express: Web framework for building the application's backend.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing link mappings and analytics data.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend technologies for user interface and interactivity.


Setup:


Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install dependencies using npm install.
